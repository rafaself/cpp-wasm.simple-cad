# 80_reporting

Applies when: a requested final report, artifact, or deliverable must be produced.

Rules (imperative)
- Reports MUST be saved as Markdown files under `/resources/reports/`.
- Naming MUST be incremental and stable: `report_<N>.md` or `report_<N>_<short-task-name>.md`.
- The report MUST include: problem, plan, files changed, risk, verification steps.
- NEVER overwrite existing reports; always create a new file with the next available `<N>`.

Verification output
- If tests or verification steps were executed, include exact commands and results (or errors) in the report.
